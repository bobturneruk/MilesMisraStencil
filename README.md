# Miles Misra Stencil

When pippetting droplets of microrganisms in suspension onto an agar plate, lines drawn in permanent marker are often used to keep track of which area of the plate holds the contents of different drops. These lines can be hand-drawn, but a stencil makes this (very slightly) quicker, easier and neater.

This simple [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) script generates .STL files which can be used to 3D print such stencils yielding results like those shown (here I used a MakerBot 2 FDM printer).
